/**
time complexity : o(n)
n : being number of nodes in the tree
space complexitu : o(h)
height of the tree

Explanation: The space complexity comes from the recursion stack used during the depth-first traversal. The maximum depth of the recursion stack will be equal to the height of the tree:
For a balanced tree (e.g., a perfect binary tree), the height 
â„Ž
h is approximately 
logn, so the space complexity in this case is 
O(logn).

For a skewed tree (e.g., a tree where each node has only one child), the height 
h could be equal to 
n, resulting in a space complexity of 
O(n).
