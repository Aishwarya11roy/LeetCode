/**
Intuition Behind the Code
Movement Direction Control: The direction arrays (rowdir and coldir) cleverly control the movement direction. The direction index (dir) is used to cycle through these directions in a fixed sequence to achieve the spiral motion.
Boundary and Visitation Checks: The main loop checks if the next step in the current direction is valid â€” that is, within the matrix boundaries and not previously visited. If the next step is invalid, the direction is changed.
Loop until all elements are visited: The loop continues until all elements of the matrix (m * n elements) are added to the result list.
Complexity
Time Complexity: O(m*n) since every element is processed exactly once.
Space Complexity: O(mn) due to the space needed for the visited array, plus O(min(m, n)) for the result list storage. However, since the result storage is required for the output, we might consider the auxiliary space usage as O(mn) mainly because of the visited array. */
